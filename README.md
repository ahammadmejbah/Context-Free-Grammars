Context Free Grammars: A grammar is a set of rules for putting strings together and so corresponds to a language.

### A grammar consists of:
• a set of variables (also called nonterminals), one of which is designated the start variable; It is customary to use upper-case letters for variables;
• a set of terminals (from the alphabet); and
• a list of productions (also called rules).
