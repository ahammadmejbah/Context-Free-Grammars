### Context Free Grammars: 
A grammar is a set of rules for putting strings together and so corresponds to a language.

### A grammar consists of:
1. A set of variables (also called nonterminals), one of which is designated the start variable; It is customary to use upper-case letters for variables;
2. A set of terminals (from the alphabet); and
3. A list of productions (also called rules).

### Here is a grammar:

  * S → 0S1
  * S → ε
  
S is the only variable. The terminals are 0 and 1. There are two productions.


A production allows one to take a string containing a variable and replace the variable by the RHS of the production. String w of terminals is generated by the grammar if, starting with the start variable, one can apply productions and end up with w. The sequence of strings so obtained is a derivation
of w.

We focus on a special version of grammars called a context-free grammar (CFG). A language is context-free if it is generated by a CFG.
