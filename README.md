### Context Free Grammars: 
A grammar is a set of rules for putting strings together and so corresponds to a language.

### A grammar consists of:
1. A set of variables (also called nonterminals), one of which is designated the start variable; It is customary to use upper-case letters for variables;
2. A set of terminals (from the alphabet); and
3. A list of productions (also called rules).

### Here is a grammar:
  S → 0S1
  S → ε
  
S is the only variable. The terminals are 0 and 1. There are two productions.
